  In this post, we’ll explore what context is, why it exists, and how to use it effectively — with examples that are both beginner-friendly and grounded in real-world use cases.
---

When you start building real-world applications in Go — especially network services, background jobs, or distributed systems — you’ll quickly encounter the context package.

It may seem mysterious at first (“Why is every function suddenly taking a ctx context.Context parameter?”), but once you understand what it’s for, it becomes one of the most valuable tools in your Go toolbox.

## What Is context in Go?

The context package provides a way to:

1. **Pass request-scoped values** across API boundaries.
2. **Control cancellation** of operations.
3. **Set timeouts or deadlines** for operations.

It’s designed to make concurrent and distributed systems more **controlled**, **coordinated**, and **predictable**.

## Why Do We Need context?

Imagine you’re building an HTTP server that calls multiple downstream services. If the client disconnects or the request times out, you want:

- All downstream calls to stop.
- All goroutines related to that request to exit cleanly.
- No wasted work or leaked resources.

Without context, you’d have to manually pass around “stop signals” and manage timeouts for each function — messy and error-prone.

context solves this by **bundling cancellation signals, deadlines, and request data into one object**.

## Create a Context

Every Go program starts with a **root context**:

```go
ctx := context.Background()
```

You can create new contexts from it:

1. **WithCancel** — manually cancel it.
2. **WithTimeout** — cancel after a fixed duration.
3. **WithDeadline** — cancel at a specific time.
4. **WithValue** — attach key-value data.

### WithCancel

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())

go func() {
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    cancel() // signal cancellation
}()

select {
case <-time.After(5 * time.Second):
    fmt.Println("Work done")
case <-ctx.Done():
    fmt.Println("Cancelled:", ctx.Err())
}
```

Output:

```sh
Cancelled: context canceled
```

### WithTimeout

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 3*time.Second)
defer cancel()

select {
case <-time.After(5 * time.Second):
    fmt.Println("Finished work")
case <-ctx.Done():
    fmt.Println("Timeout:", ctx.Err())
}
```

Output:

```go
Timeout: context deadline exceeded
```

## Passing Context to Functions

The convention in Go is **always pass context as the first parameter**:

```go
func fetchData(ctx context.Context, url string) error {
    req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", url, nil)
    resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()
    // process data
    return nil
}
```

This ensures that any I/O or long-running work inside fetchData can stop when the context is cancelled.

## Using WithValue (Carefully!)

You can attach request-scoped data to a context:

```go
ctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), "userID", 42)
userID := ctx.Value("userID").(int)
fmt.Println(userID)
```

⚠️ **Best Practice**: Only store small, immutable, request-scoped values (like auth tokens, IDs). Do **not** store large data structures or configuration.

## Common Pattern

### HTTP Request Lifecycle

Pass r.Context() from HTTP handlers to downstream calls so everything stops when the client disconnects.

```go
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    data, err := fetchData(r.Context(), "https://example.com")
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusRequestTimeout)
        return
    }
    fmt.Fprintln(w, data)
}
```

### goroutine Coordination

Stop multiple goroutines when one fails or the job is done.

```go
func worker(ctx context.Context, id int) {
    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            fmt.Println("Worker", id, "stopping")
            return
        default:
            fmt.Println("Worker", id, "working...")
            time.Sleep(time.Second)
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        go worker(ctx, i)
    }
    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
    cancel()
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

## Best Practices

✅ **Always pass context.Context explicitly** as the first argument.

✅ **Always call cancel()** for contexts created with WithCancel, WithTimeout, or WithDeadline (to free resources).

✅ **Use context.Background()** for root contexts in main functions, tests, or initialization.

✅ **Use context.TODO()** as a placeholder when you’re not sure yet.

⚠️ **Don’t abuse WithValue** — prefer function parameters for most data.

## Conclusion

The context package might feel like “extra plumbing” at first, but in distributed, concurrent systems, it’s a **lifesaver**.

It gives you:

- A unified way to cancel work.
- Deadlines without manual timers.
- A safe way to propagate request-scoped data.

If you start using context early in your Go projects, you’ll avoid goroutine leaks, prevent wasted work, and write code that’s easier to maintain and reason about.
