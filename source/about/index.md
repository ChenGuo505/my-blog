# What's up, I'm Chen!

Welcome to my place! I'm a passionate programmer and currently studying in [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu) as a Master student. I am dedicated to turning ideas into reality through code, with an exceptional pursuit of **simplicity** and **elegance** in programming.

## My skills?

- Algorithm: Analysing and designing efficient algorithms to achieve **high performance**.
- Network Programming: Building web server based on **I/O multiplexing**.
- Web Development: Creating applications for **web**, **iOS** and **Android**(learning ...).
- Backend Development: Developing robust backend systems with **Nodejs**, **Spring** or **Flask**.
- Container Technology: Building and deploying applications with **Docker**.
- Language: Chinese(first language ), English, Japanese(learning...).
- Always exploring new tools, frameworks, and technologies to stay at the cutting edge.

## I enjoy...

- Anime, **all kind of anime**. Actually, I used to be more obsessed, but now I watch less because of too many things going on in real life. Here are some anime that I've watched recently(btw, my favorite is **K-ON** which I watched several years ago):
  - アオのハコ
  - 負げヒロインが多すぎる
  - ガールスバンドクライ
  - BanG Dream! It's MyGO!!!!!
  - Update ongoing...
- Game. Action, strategy, RPG, sandbox... Although I'm not a hardcore gamer, I still have some games that I really enjoy:
  - **DARK SOULS III**(highly recommend)
  - Elden Ring
  - Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  - Cyberpunk 2077
  - Black Myth: Wukong
  - Dyson Sphere Program
  - Civilization VI
  - Phigros(iPad/other tablet)
  - Update ongoing...

Always open to recommendations for great anime and games!
